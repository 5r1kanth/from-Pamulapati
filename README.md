# Srikanth Pamulapati
###### AFC - Amaravathi Food Court

I will suggest this place to you if you're looking for a **decent place** in our town that is also within your budget.<br>
That is my preferred place to eat. **It's a food court that has the atmosphere of a real restaurant.**<br>
I adore the great range of cuisine this business has to offer. At least once a week, my buddies and I visit there.<br>
Every time I visit, I like the welcoming ambiance, the food's flavor, and the attentive service.
