### Code Fencing - SQL code snippets

##### Left-Join

The Left Join command in SQL returns all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table. The result is no records from the right side if there is not a match.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

```
